The company introduced free credit score monitoring on there platform introducing transparency to customers. 
Canadians with poor credit score or those who are new to Canada might find themselves unable to access loans and if they do they will have a high interest. Mogo is providing loan preapprovals that do not impact a consumers credit score which can be very helpful if the credit score is already struggling. The preapproval takes less than 4 minutes which is significantly less time compared to the average lender. 
They offer small fixed term installment loans which are significantly easier and less expensive to pay off compared to credit card debt with compounding interest. These installment loans are flexible and can be paid in full at anytime with no penalty.
