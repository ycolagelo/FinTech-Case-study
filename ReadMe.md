## Business Activities:

With 64% of Canadians in debt and the most common being credit card debt,Mogo set out to find ways for Canadians to spend smarter, increase wealth and avoid debt traps like credit cards. 


With that in mind Mogo introduced free credit score monitoring on there platform bringing transparency to customers. The idea behind this was to enable Canadians have credit score visibility and understanding of personal credit score and how to improve it or maintain it. 
Canadians with poor credit score or those new to Canada might find themselves unable to access loans and if they do they will have a high interest. Mogo provides loan preapprovals that do not impact a consumers credit score. This can be very helpful if the credit score is already struggling. This online preapproval takes less than 4 minutes which is significantly less time compared to the average lender which can sometimes take a week or two depending on the process and the advisor working on the file.  

They offer small fixed term installment loans which are significantly easier and less expensive to pay off compared to credit card debt with compounding interest. These installment loans are flexible and can be paid in full at anytime with no penalty.


Alongside small loans Mogo also offers smart mortgages and unique prepaid visa debt card to its customers. Mogo has since evolved to add new products for its customers including Trading Platform, Cryptocurrency, Smart Saving account and Registered Savings account.

Mogo is a millennial and next Gen focused brand. Standard banking methods can be time consuming and difficult to navigate in a changing Financial climate which is why Mogo is making banking more accessible and simplified which is important for today and the fast paced life we are now living. 
The introduction of commission free stock trading and blockchain technology to the platform made the company even more attractive to its end users and thus growing the companies market size. 
Mogo has since surpassed the 2 million member milestone as of June 30, 2022.

What sets Mogo apart from competitors is their ability to offer small loans to customers at a fair or below market interest rate regardless the credit score. 


The use of technology has enabled the to process information faster, reduce wait time and present financial information to the consumer in a user friendly and easy to understand format.
Mogo is actively taking steps to reduce carbon footprint by directing funds to plant trees every time a member uses a Mogocard. This climate action has given them a spotlight in the market they are invested in. The whole world and especially Millennials and the younger generation are greatly concerned about the impact of global warming, tying a solution to their banking is very innovative.

## Technology used

Literature on the technology used by Mogo is difficult to come by with websites like [infiniums.com](http://infiniums.com/mogo-2/) listing Some of the technology used my Mogo to include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript for front end development.
After several searches with no results I come across a job posting on [google](https://www.google.ca/search?source=hp&ei=PkvSWq7iIKXr5gLx9I_ABQ&btnG=Search&q=mogo+jobs&oq=node+run+global+module+other+user&gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i160k1.501.5624.0.5833.34.21.0.11.11.0.142.2088.11j10.21.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..2.30.1932.0..0j35i39k1j0i67k1j0i131k1j0i131i67k1j0i20i263k1j0i22i30k1j33i21k1.0.4EKADFMmk4k&ibp=htl;jobs&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiHwMejqLb7AhU_kYkEHWWtA3UQkd0GegQIEBAB#fpstate=tldetail&htivrt=jobs&htiq=mogo+jobs&htidocid=xdmk8mPrtDAAAAAAAAAAAA%3D%3D&sxsrf=ALiCzsbPJJ0dbz-GLmYtlUm1EUPtfQ7igg:1668725865577) that named some of the technologies required for a back end job at Mogo.

This has been Mogos business impact so far?

Since Mogo started in 2003 offering free credit score check and small loans on the Platform, they have since accelerated and further enhanced products to enable them support their growing member base. Product enhancements include Mogo Trade (a trading platform), the ability to buy and sell cryptocurrency, automatic approval for account opening,  instant funding and ability to receive in-app monthly statements. 
Mogo's total member base has since increased by approximately 18% from 1695,000 in June 2021 to 2007,000 in June 2022
In alignment with the plan to help Canadians achieve financial freedom while addressing climate change, Mogo announced that it has reached one million trees milestone on April 22 2022. 
With climate change included in their business model, Mogo has been able to provide a Financial platform that provides its customers with an easy and accessible way to take climate action. Every time a customer uses a mogocard, a tree is planted. This has not only increased Mogos Member base but also addressed a critical issue the world is currently facing.

## Compared to other FinTech Companies

Compared to Borrowell, WealthSimple and Lending Loop, Mogo Financial provides a wide variety of products and services to its Members. 

Borrowell is primarily focused on providing credit score and lending, WealthSimple is primarily focused on savings, registered accounts and investing and Lending Loop is mainly focused on providing loans to small businesses. 

Mogo provides not only credit score tracking and lending but also digital spending account, digital mortgage, identity fraud protection, trading platform and  the ability to trade digital currency. 
Mogo is also publicly listed which has enabled it to increase revenue for expansion. 
Based on product provision, Mogo ranks top among its competitors. 

With that in mind we have seen companies like Borrowell and WealthSimple growing rapidly and increasing in market size. 
Both WealthSimple and Borrowell are highly specialised in the services they offer making them the go to place for anyone looking for that particular service. 

For instance, Borrowell offers highly in depth and detailed credit score report with tailored advice on how one can improve or maintain their credit score. Borrowell also tailors financial recommendations to the customers needs plus transparent and comparably low loan interest rate. These features give Borrowell an advantage in the FinTech domain with consumers looking to improve credit and those who are not supported by A lenders for various reasons. 

WealthSimple has a well put together and user friendly trading platform in addition to the availability of registered accounts. This makes WealthSimple the go to for customers that are interested in long term saving and tax advantages. Mogo only started offering Registered accounts in 2022 long after WealthSimple was already offering the accounts making the competition very fierce. 

Much as all these companies are in the FinTech domain, they all have a unique way of offering products and catering to specific financial needs. Having said that, the ability for Mogo to offer a variety of products sets it apart from its competitors in a way that Mogo's customers can have all their banking under one platform.

## Recommendations

One product and service that I would suggest that Mogo added is the ability to make Wills and Power of Attorney(POA) on the platform. 
Since Mogo's target market is Millennials (next generation), the following demographic doesn't always see the immediate need to put a Will together as well as a POA. This important need will always go overlooked by todays generation and yet it's a very crucial part of Financial planning. The younger generation often finds the process of putting a Will/POA together tedious and expensive due to the lawyer fees, time and paperwork involved in putting it all together. 


Having Mogo's customers have the ability to make a Will/POA on their platform will be of great benefit in the following ways:
The customers will have a start to finish banking service. As the customers life changes with time i.e having children and buying a home, the need to protect assets the need to plan for the unexpected also increases. 
This demographic will appreciate the ease of having their wealth accumulate, assets planned and looked after under one app. 

Including this service will not only increase Membership because of the ease but it will also build trust and retention with the company and in turn increase revenue.

Since Climate Change is part of Mogo's business model, offering this service will greatly reduce on the paperwork usually involved in process of making Wills/POAs contributing to a greener world. 

Having a Will/POA on file will simplify the process of reconciling bank accounts should anything happen to a customer. With banking going digital, dispatchment of proceeds after death can present unexpected challenges. This can be addressed with proper digital documentation that is stored and updated electronically making the whole process simple and accessible.

The addition of this feature will not only simplify this process for the customer but it also extend financial protection to the customers family building trust and potential increasing membership.

---

The following technologies can be used in used to aid the addition of Wills/POA on the Mogo platform:
* Active Record
* PostgreSQL
* Ruby on Rails

These technologies are appropriate when handling large scalable data while providing the appropriate security. 
Ruby on Rails can be used for its ability to create a high performance platform as well as detect and rectify any errors. It can be used to administer interactions between modal and view. Ruby on Rails has inbuild security measures and libraries to make coding mush faster and seamless for the developer.
PostgreSQL is a highly stable database management system that makes it dependable for storing data. 

Active Record can be used for representing data and logic. It stores data in relational database that makes it easy to manipulate and update. 

Python can be used to make the forms for the end user.

## Conclusion
Financial Technology is by far making the financial world more efficient. Traditional banks are getting the much needed competition that will result in reduction of fees for the consumer. Banks are now forced to develop technology in order to keep up with the growing FinTech Domain. The emergence of Crypto Currency has caused disruption in the traditional banking system exposing the weaknesses and cracks in todays financial system. The younger generation is looking for innovative waits to take control of their finances and accumulate wealth. Paying high trading fees, account fees and credit card fees is not attractive anymore. 

Digital banks offer cheaper and faster services with the ability to trade in digital currency which is by far out pacing traditional banks and paving a way into the future of banking. 
Its 

It is obvious that traditional banks will either have to evolve to keep up or lose popularity. The emergence of FinTech as is very exciting and I believe that with innovation, banking is going to be brought to a whole new level.
